Hello! My name is Bakhtiar Mohammadzadeh and I am a 3rd year EIE student at Imperial College London. This is a website showcasing my achievements and goals. More generally, my goal is to contribute to developing innovative solutions to issues in the modern day. I enjoy challenging and meaningful work where I can contribute and learn. On a completely unrelated note, my hobbies include going to the gym and playing video games.

Feel free to explore the website and contact me at bm920@ic.ac.uk if you have any questions.
