Hello! My name is Bakhtiar Mohammadzadeh and I am a 3rd year EIE student at Imperial College London. This is a website showcasing my achievements and goals. More generally, my goal is to contribute to developing innovative solutions to issues in the modern day. I enjoy challenging and meaningful work where I can contribute and learn. On a completely unrelated note, my hobbies include going to the gym and playing video games.

Feel free to explore the website and contact me at bm920@ic.ac.uk if you have any questions.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
