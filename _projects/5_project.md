<h3><b>Simon Says: A Multiplayer Battle Royale Game for Physiotherapy and Entertainment</b></h3>
<p>SimonSays, a multiplayer battle royale game designed to provide an engaging and entertaining outlet for children in need of physiotherapy. The game utilizes an FPGA-based controller equipped with accelerometers and digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities. The software was developed using Python, incorporating innovative gameplay mechanics inspired by the classic Simon-Says game. </p>

<h5><b>Introduction:</b></h5>
<p>Children undergoing physiotherapy often require engaging activities to motivate and encourage regular exercise. This was the motivation for "SimonSays" a multiplayer battle royale game specifically designed to address this need. By merging the excitement of a battle royale game with physiotherapy exercises, SimonSays aims to provide an entertaining and immersive experience while promoting physical movement and rehabilitation.</p>

<h5><b>Hardware Architecture:</b></h5>
<p>The core hardware component of Simon Says is an FPGA-based controller. The controller integrates accelerometers to capture player movement and digital signal processing capabilities to analyze the accelerometer data. These features allow the game to interpret the player's actions and respond accordingly. The FPGA's reprogrammability and high-speed processing enable real-time gameplay and responsiveness.</p>

<h5><b>Software Development:</b></h5>
<p>The software for Simon Says was developed using Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language. Python offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks suitable for game development. The game's software architecture follows a modular design, allowing for scalability and easy integration of additional features in the future.</p>

<h5><b>Game Mechanics:</b></h5>
<p>Simon Says incorporates gameplay mechanics inspired by the classic Simon Says game, where players must replicate a sequence of movements or actions. In the multiplayer battle royale version, players compete against each other, aiming to survive and become the last player standing by correctly mimicking the given sequences. Each round, players who fail to replicate the sequence are eliminated until only one remains, crowned as the champion.</p>

<h5><b>Exercise Integration:</b></h5>
<p>To support the physiotherapy aspect of the game, Simon Says incorporates specific exercises within the gameplay. These exercises are carefully designed to encourage physical movement and enhance motor skills. For example, players might be required to perform stretches, balance exercises, or controlled arm movements as part of the sequence. The game provides real-time feedback to players, ensuring correct execution and progress tracking.</p>

<h5><b>Benefits for Physiotherapy:</b></h5>
<p>Simon Says serves as an interactive tool to facilitate physiotherapy sessions, especially for children. By combining enjoyable gameplay with necessary exercises, the game aims to increase motivation and adherence to therapy routines. The competitive nature of the battle royale format promotes engagement, while the integration of physiotherapy exercises targets specific areas of improvement. Regular play can help improve motor coordination, strength, and overall physical fitness.</p>

<h5><b>Conclusion:</b></h5>
<p>Simon Says presents an innovative approach to incorporating physiotherapy exercises into a multiplayer battle royale game. By utilizing an FPGA-based controller with accelerometers and DSP, coupled with Python-based software, the game offers a unique and interactive experience for children in need of physiotherapy. The fusion of entertainment and rehabilitation elements provides an engaging outlet for completing exercises while fostering motivation and adherence. Simon Says demonstrates the potential of technology and gamification in supporting the rehabilitation process.</p>

<h5><b>Future Work</b></h5>
<p>As a continuous project, future enhancements can be considered to expand the game's capabilities and impact. These may include:</p>

<ul> <li>Integration of additional exercise types to target a broader range of physical therapy needs.</li>
<li>Implementation of adaptive difficulty levels to accommodate various skill levels and abilities.</li>
<li>Collaborative gameplay modes to encourage social interaction</li>
