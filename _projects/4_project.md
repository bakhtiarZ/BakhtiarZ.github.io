<p>The project involved the development of ProPutter, an innovative embedded system IoT product designed to enhance golf performance. ProPutter combined both hardware and software components to analyze golf swings, provide insightful analytics, and offer criticisms aimed at improving the player's technique. Additionally, the product included social media features and a web application to create a comprehensive golf improvement ecosystem.</p>

<h6><b>Hardware Development:</b></h6>
<p>The hardware component of ProPutter was designed to be attached to a user's golf club. It consisted of sensors, accelerometers, and gyroscopes strategically placed to capture data during the swing. These sensors would detect and measure key swing parameters such as swing speed, clubface angle, impact position, and swing path.</p>

<p>The collected data from the hardware sensors was processed and transmitted to the software component of ProPutter for further analysis and interpretation.</p>

<h6><b>Software Development:</b></h6>
<p>The software component of ProPutter encompassed a range of functionalities aimed at analyzing and improving the user's golf swing. The software included the following key aspects:</p>

<h6><b>Data Analysis and Insights:</b></h6>
<p>The swing data captured by the hardware was analyzed using sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques. The software would provide detailed analytics, including graphical representations of the swing path, clubface angle at impact, and tempo analysis. These insights allowed users to identify areas for improvement in their technique.</p>

<h6><b>Personalized Suggestions and Criticisms:</b></h6>
<p>ProPutter utilized the analyzed data to provide personalized suggestions and criticisms to the user. Based on the individual's swing data, the software would identify specific areas of improvement, offer corrective advice, and suggest drills or exercises to enhance their performance.</p>

<h6><b>Social Media Integration:</b></h6>
<p>ProPutter incorporated social media features, enabling users to share their swing data, achievements, and improvements with others in their golfing community. This facilitated healthy competition, knowledge sharing, and motivation among users.</p>

<h6><b>Web Application:</b></h6>
<p>A web application was developed to complement the ProPutter hardware and software. The web app allowed users to access their swing data, analytics, and personalized suggestions from any device with internet access. It also served as a platform for user interactions, providing forums, discussion boards, and further resources to support their golf improvement journey.</p>

<p>The project involved a multidisciplinary team, including hardware engineers, software developers, data scientists, user experience designers, and web developers. Close collaboration among team members was vital to ensure seamless integration between the hardware and software components and to deliver a user-friendly and feature-rich product.</p>

<p>Throughout the project, extensive testing and iteration were conducted to refine the accuracy, reliability, and user experience of ProPutter. User feedback and insights played a crucial role in identifying areas for enhancement and implementing software updates.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the development of ProPutter aimed to provide golf enthusiasts with a comprehensive tool to analyze their swings, receive personalized feedback, and connect with a community of like-minded individuals passionate about improving their golf skills.</p>
